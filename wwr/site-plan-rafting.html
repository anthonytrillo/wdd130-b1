    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      My purpose in sharing knowledge about programming is to empower individuals with the ability to create and innovate through technology. I believe that programming is an essential skill in today's digital age, and it has the potential to revolutionize various industries. By sharing my programming knowledge, I hope to create a community of individuals who can contribute to the development of innovative solutions and technologies that can benefit society as a whole. Additionally, I want to help bridge the digital divide and provide opportunities for individuals who may not have had access to this type of education before. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>As a content creator, I see my potential audience for programming content as individuals who are interested in learning programming as a hobby or those who are seeking to improve their programming skills for personal or professional development. My audience may consist of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, ranging from beginners with little to no prior programming knowledge to more experienced programmers looking to expand their skill set. They may be interested in a variety of programming languages, tools, and platforms, and may have different goals for their programming journey, such as building websites, mobile apps, or data analysis tools. To provide them with a valuable and engaging learning experience, I aim to understand their needs and interests, and tailor my content accordingly.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
