  <h1>Personal Website Proposal</h1>

  <h4>For my website proposal I chose to make a website for my personal portfolio.</h4>

  <p>The main objective of this website is to showcase my career as a programmer and highlight the skills I have acquired throughout my education. Through a modern design and an intuitive interface.</p>

  <p>This portfolio will help me to show my future employers the projects I have worked on, the knowledge and experience I have gained.</p>
