      Hey friends, my name is Anthony Trillo, and I'm a programmer working for an IT consulting firm.
      My work mainly focuses on software development, and I've been involved in several projects across
      different domains for our clients. I'm a team player and a proactive person who likes to get things done.
    </p>

      Apart from work, I like to stay active by playing table tennis and engaging in sports activities.
      I also love to travel and explore new cultures, which has helped me broaden my perspective and gain new skills and knowledge.
    </p>

      Some years back, I had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission in southern Peru, which taught me a lot about teamwork,
      perseverance, and long-term vision. If you have any questions about my professional experience or want to know more about me,
      feel free to ask!
